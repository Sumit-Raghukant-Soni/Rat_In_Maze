## Introduction

The "Rat in a Maze" problem is a classic algorithmic problem that involves finding a path for a rat from its starting position to the destination while avoiding obstacles in a maze. This project aims to visually represent the rat's traversal through the maze, demonstrating the algorithm's steps.

## Features

- **Maze Generation**: The project generates a random maze with obstacles and a clear path from the starting point to the destination.
- **Step-by-Step Visualization**: The algorithm's steps are visualized one by one, showcasing how the rat navigates through the maze.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you need a web browser installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sumit-Raghukant-Soni/Rat_In_Maze.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd rat-in-maze-visualization
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

Use this project to understand and visualize how the "Rat in a Maze" algorithm works. Customize the maze dimensions, obstacle placement, and animation speed to experiment with different scenarios. This project can also serve as an educational tool to teach others about pathfinding algorithms.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the visualization.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the visualization.
- `main.js`: The JavaScript file for implementing the maze generation and animation.
- `Images/`: Directory containing images used in the visualization.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are appreciated! If you have ideas for improving the visualization, enhancing the algorithm, or adding more features, please submit a pull request. Follow the project's coding standards and guidelines.
